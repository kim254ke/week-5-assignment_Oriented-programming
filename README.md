# Python OOP Assignment

This project has two parts:

1. Furniture Example (Inheritance) 
   - I created a Furniture class and then made a Chair and Table that inherit from it.

2. Animal Voices (Polymorphism)  
   - I created a base Animal class and made Sheep, Pig, and Goat, each with a different `speak()` sound.
